## GitHub Flavored Markdown

Letâ€™s get the whole "linebreak" thing out of the way. The next paragraph contains two phrases separated by a single newline character:

Roses are red  
Violets are blue

The next paragraph has the same phrases, but now they are separated by two spaces and a newline character:

Roses are red  
  
Violets are blue

Oh, and one thing I cannot stand is the mangling of words with multiple underscores in them like `perform_complicated_task` or `do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing`.

## A Bit of the GitHub Spice

In addition to the changes in the previous section, certain references are auto-linked:

- SHA: `be6a8cc1c1ecfe9489fb51e4869af15a13fc2cd2`
- User@SHA ref: [mojombo@be6a8cc](https://github.com/mojombo/product/commit/be6a8cc1c1ecfe9489fb51e4869af15a13fc2cd2)
- User/Project@SHA: [mojombo/god@be6a8cc](https://github.com/mojombo/god/commit/be6a8cc1c1ecfe9489fb51e4869af15a13fc2cd2)
- Issue number: [#1](https://github.com/github/product/issues/1)

These are dangerous goodies though, and we need to make sure email addresses don't get mangled:

My email addy is [tom@github.com](mailto:tom@github.com).

## Math is hard, letâ€™s go shopping

In first grade I learned that 5 > 3 and 2 < 7. Maybe some arrows: 1 -> 2 -> 3. 9 <- 8 <- 7.

Triangles man! `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`

## We all like making lists

Now, for a list of fruits:

- Red Apples
- Purple Grapes
- Green Kiwifruits

Letâ€™s get crazy:

1. This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
   
   Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.

2. Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

### What about some code in a list?

In Ruby you can map like this:

```ruby
['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }
